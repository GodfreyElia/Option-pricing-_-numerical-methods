Option Pricing Dashboard
This Shiny application provides an interactive dashboard for exploring and comparing different numerical methods used to price European and American options. It dynamically fetches live market data for the S&P 500 (^GSPC), VIX Index (^VIX), and 13-week U.S. Treasury Bill yield (^IRX) from Yahoo Finance, allowing for up-to-date analysis.

Features
Dynamic Data Fetching: Automatically retrieves the latest S&P 500 prices, VIX volatility, and risk-free rates directly from Yahoo Finance.
Black-Scholes-Merton (BSM) Model: Calculate theoretical prices for European call and put options.
Monte Carlo Simulation: Price options through simulating numerous future price paths of the underlying asset.
Binomial Tree Model: Support for both European and American call and put options, illustrating the flexibility of the binomial model for early exercise scenarios.
Interactive Plots: Visualize option prices and VIX movements over the last 252 trading days (approximately one year).
Benchmarking Tab:
Price Comparison: Directly compare the prices generated by BSM, Monte Carlo, and Binomial Tree models on a single chart.
Pricing Errors: Analyze the absolute differences (errors) between Monte Carlo and Binomial Tree (European) prices relative to the Black-Scholes benchmark.
Customizable Parameters: Adjust strike prices, option types (call/put), and option styles (American/European for Binomial Tree) via intuitive slider and dropdown inputs.
How to Use
Install R and RStudio: If you don't have them, download and install R and RStudio Desktop.

Install Required R Packages: Open RStudio and run the following commands to install the necessary packages:

R

install.packages(c("shiny", "quantmod", "plotly", "readxl", "DT", "dplyr"))
Download the App: Clone or download this repository to your local machine.

Run the App:

Open the app.R file in RStudio.
Click the "Run App" button at the top of the script pane.
The application will launch in your default web browser or in the RStudio Viewer pane.

Project Structure
The project consists of a single app.R file, which contains both the User Interface (UI) and Server logic for the Shiny application.

app.R: The main application file, including:
UI Definition: Defines the layout and interactive elements of the dashboard.
Server Logic: Contains the reactive expressions for data fetching, option pricing calculations, and rendering of plots.
Option Pricing Functions: Implementations of the Black-Scholes, Monte Carlo, and Binomial Tree models.
Data Source
The application utilizes the quantmod package to fetch real-time financial data from Yahoo Finance.

S&P 500 (SPX): ^GSPC
VIX Index: ^VIX
13-Week U.S. Treasury Bill Yield (Risk-Free Rate): ^IRX
Technical Details
Strike Price Range: The strike price sliders are set between 4500 and 6500, reflecting current market levels for the S&P 500.
Maturity: All option pricing models assume a 1-year maturity (T=1).
VIX for Volatility: The VIX index is used to derive the annualized daily volatility (sigma).
IRX for Risk-Free Rate: The latest 13-week T-Bill yield is used as the annualized risk-free rate (r).
Binomial Tree Steps: The Binomial Tree models use 50 steps for their calculations.
Monte Carlo Simulations: The Monte Carlo model uses 1000 simulations for its calculations.
